# React + Vite

I have used Vite react for this website and for styling I have used Chakra-ui.

This website is a prototype website for the crypto currency information. 
I have fetched the current data from the coingecko. 
It shows first 100 crypto currencies details and the exchange rates.
I have used  chart first time in this project, It was pretty tough though.
I have few plans for this website, I'll work on this website more.
